# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**AI Systems in the Physical World**

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on building AI-powered robots. This 13-week curriculum bridges Python agents to ROS 2 controllers, taking you from fundamental robotics concepts to deploying Vision-Language-Action models on real humanoid robots.

## Course Overview

This course is designed for advanced students with Python programming experience who want to master embodied intelligence—the integration of AI with physical robotic systems.

### What You'll Learn

- **ROS 2 Mastery**: Build robust robotic systems using the Robot Operating System 2
- **Digital Twin Development**: Create realistic simulations with Gazebo, Unity, and Isaac Sim
- **AI Integration**: Implement VSLAM, autonomous navigation, and perception systems
- **Vision-Language-Action**: Deploy cutting-edge LLM-powered robotics

## Curriculum Structure

| Module | Weeks | Focus Area |
|--------|-------|------------|
| **The Robotic Nervous System** | 1-3 | ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services |
| **The Digital Twin** | 4-6 | Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim |
| **The AI-Robot Brain** | 7-9 | VSLAM, Nav2, Perception |
| **Vision-Language-Action** | 10-13 | LLMs, Whisper, VLA Capstone |
